st.write("Progress has been made in the fight against the illegal ivory trade, however, with that progress comes new challenges. Now that the elephant population has started to recover from the ivory trade, they now face a new world where humans have taken over a large percentage of their habitat. So, as elephants try to recover, they are killed by human inhabitants of the area simply for existing. There is a clear problem here for both elephants and humans: humans expanded their agricultrure and farming because the area was available while the ivory trade was in full swing, but now that drastic efforts have been made to save elephants - and those efforts have worked - elephants are being killed off again for a different reason. This is an endless cycle and it is crucial that steps are taken to understand the challenge and we take action in saving the elephants.")
